# 🪐 Saturn Gesture Particles

A high-end, interactive 3D particle system built with **Three.js** and **MediaPipe Hands**. Control cosmic shapes and explosive effects using simple hand gestures in real-time.

## ✨ Features

- **Hyper-Realistic Particles**: Uses custom shaders and premium textures for an ethereal, glowing look (avoiding the "cartoonish" look).
- **Smooth Interaction**: Real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe for fluid particle following.
- **Dynamic Physics**: Includes fountain-like spray effects, gravitational arcs, and organic heartbeat pulsations.
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Particles dynamically resize during explosive effects for maximum visual impact.

## 🤟 Gesture Guide

| Gesture                           | Action          | Visual Effect                                                                     |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **✊ Fist** (0 Fingers)           | **Saturn Form** | Particles form a large Saturn planet with a dense ring.                           |
| **🖐️ Open Hand** (5 Fingers)      | **Ring Burst**  | Trigger a continuous, high-velocity fountain of particles from the planet's core. |
| **✌️ Peace Sign** (2 Fingers)     | **I LOVE U**    | Particles transform into floating "I LOVE U" text.                                |
| **🤟 Metal Sign** (Index + Pinky) | **Love Heart**  | Particles form a 3D "puffy" balloon heart that beats with a natural rhythm.       |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Allow camera access when prompted.
4. Click the **"START EXPERIENCE"** button.
5. High-five the air and start controlling the particles!

> **Note**: For the best performance, use a browser that supports WebGL (Chrome/Edge/Safari).

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - 3D Engine
